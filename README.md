## Goal and Philosophy

  Users who can just use computers simply will be able to make their own recipes, advancements, loot tables and so on.

## What's DataMaker
  
  A windows program written in c# that can help users make minecraft data packs.

## Why DataMaker

  Mojang AB added new feature(bug?) called data pack in minecraft 1.13. 
  
  > The data pack system provides a way for players to further customize their Minecraft experience. Data packs can be used to override or add new advancements, functions, loot tables, structures, recipes and tags without any code modification. (From [minecraft wiki](https://minecraft.gamepedia.com/Data_pack).)
  
  But players have to write a lot of json files (that's inconvenient) to make it, so i made this program.
